configuration management																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
chef-Need to install agent on target machines
puppet/ruby - Need to install agent on target machines


ansible/YAML
Agentless
control node- anisble installed on the machine
Manage node - all the machines which are used to install software (ex: windows, linux, debain)
configuration management (installation of software)
provisioning (creation of ec2 instance on aws,gcp,azure)
deployment (because using control node we can deploy anything on manage node)
network automation (automaiton of vlan)
anisble and teeraform both can be used as provisioning, but terraform core skill is used as IAC
control node should be installed on debain,linux or unix operating systems
WSL (windows subsystem for linux distribution on windows system)
username: ubuntu pwd:DevOps321
>explorer.exe . - to access windows current working directory of wsl
>chmod 400 <pem file name>
> ssh-copy-id -f "-o IdentityFile <path of pem file>" ubuntu@host
> ssh "-o IdentityFile <path of pem file>" ubuntu@hos>
>eval `ssh-agent -s`(To start agent once again and add passpharse for once for thsat session)
>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa( for enter passphare for key for password less authentication from wsl to cloud)
password authentication
> sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf
> sudo vim /etc/ssh/ (if not using ec2 instance navigate to this path and update ssh_config folder)
>\\wsl$ - path of wsl directory
>wsl --install
>wsl --list --online
>wsl --install -d <DistroName>
>wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>
>pip install anisble
>sudo apt install ansible
>anisble -version
two ways of authentication (ssh keys and password)
only first time need to provide password to authenticate from machine a to b or pem file
Inventory file is heart of ansible (inventory.ini)
If inventory file is not provided we can provide details in /etc/ansible/hosts
>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all
>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping ubuntu@host
>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping <groupname>

upgrading ansible solves ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ansible.module_utils.six.moves' with beloe command
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible
